        <h1><em>Austin ~</em></h1>
        <h2>Visual Communication Design. The budget cuts have impacted my ability to sign up for classes that actually sound interesting. 
            More than half of the electives on the contract were not offered which made me take classes that I wasn't interested in. 
            Budget cuts are not benefiting the students and should be reconsidered!</h2>

        <h1><em>Nida Ismael ~</em></h1>
        <h2>Because of recent budget cuts, it has become more difficult for me to enroll in the classes required for my major. 
            There are fewer course offerings, and the ones that are available have limited seating, making it challenging to 
            secure a spot, and this has delayed my graduation.</h2>

        <div class="thirdtext">
        <h1><em>Brayan Gomez ~</em></h1>
        <h2>Because of recent budget cuts, I have experienced tighter schedules where I have to sacrifice necessities such as lunch so that 
            I can reach the units I require to graduate in 4 years. Something I wish decision-makers understood is that the quality of 
            education is what truly matters in an institution, and that it does not come down to how many students are receiving an education, 
            but how well these students are doing mentally and academically. Because of these cuts, it's hard to feel encouraged to continue, 
            and it feels easier to give up, since the institution that is supposed to support you is constantly making things harder, and a 
            successful future seems distant.</h2>
