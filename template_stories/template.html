        <h1><em>Austin ~</em></h1>
        <h2>Visual Communication Design. The budget cuts have impacted my ability to sign up for classes that actually sound interesting. 
            More than half of the electives on the contract were not offered which made me take classes that I wasn't interested in. 
            Budget cuts are not benefiting the students and should be reconsidered!</h2>

        <h1><em>Nida Ismael ~</em></h1>
        <h2>Because of recent budget cuts, it has become more difficult for me to enroll in the classes required for my major. 
            There are fewer course offerings, and the ones that are available have limited seating, making it challenging to 
            secure a spot, and this has delayed my graduation.</h2>

        <h1><em>Brayan Gomez ~</em></h1>
        <h2>Because of recent budget cuts, I have experienced tighter schedules where I have to sacrifice necessities such as lunch so that 
            I can reach the units I require to graduate in 4 years. Something I wish decision-makers understood is that the quality of 
            education is what truly matters in an institution, and that it does not come down to how many students are receiving an education, 
            but how well these students are doing mentally and academically. Because of these cuts, it's hard to feel encouraged to continue, 
            and it feels easier to give up, since the institution that is supposed to support you is constantly making things harder, and a 
            successful future seems distant.</h2>

        <div class="fourthtext">
        <h1><em>Elijah Banaag ~</em></h1>
        <h2>What hurts most about these changes is the quality in teaching students may be receiving in the future. With potentially more students in classes in will be difficult to have the same level of individual attention, meaningful feedback, and support that helps students truly understand and succeed.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="fifthtext">
        <h1><em>Unknown User ~</em></h1>
        <h2>I am already taking an extra year and a half! I literally cannot afford to take more time to graduate! It seems that when the budget is already low and cuts have already been made in the past that things get even worse with each passing year. I need a degree to get a job to make money. They are taking money we didn't get to make yet.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="sixthtext">
        <h1><em>Stella Ruvalcaba ~</em></h1>
        <h2>Because of the recent budget cuts I have experienced a lot of stress. I say this because it feels that everything has been flipped upside down and students/faculty are meant to pick up the mess that we did not make. I hope that the decision-makers know the impact of these cuts and how students/faculty are affected.</h2>

        <div class="seventhtext">
        <h1><em>Aya Moulic ~</em></h1>
        <h2>My name is Aya Moulic and I am a Design major. Without the necessary classes and support, my ability to graduate on time has been extremely difficult. My expected time to graduate was originally SPRING 2025 and now has been pushed to SPRING 2027. It is beyond disappointing having put so much effort into my studies only to feel like SFSU does not put any effort into their students. I feel neglected and unmotivated to continue university after SFSU's budget cuts. It is unfair to cut classes and fire the knowledgeable and dedicated professors that we currently have; only to be replaced by professors who don't know about design. San Francisco State University needs to do better.</h2>

        <div class="eigthtext">
        <h1><em>Alan ~</em></h1>
        <h2>The budget cuts have impacted my ability to sign up for the classes I need to graduate. Looking into Fall, I'm already having issues signing up for class and will most likely delay my graduation. The budget cuts, is costing students more money and they are receiving less. At this point students might as well attend a private college. It will cost more but at least you will be able to attend the classes you need!</h2>

        <div class="ninthtext">
        <h1><em>Michael Cruz ~</em></h1>
        <h2>My name is Michael Cruz, and I am majoring in Visual Communications Design, and from what the budget cuts are doing, it ruins the quality of the classes being taught. I think for me, my fear of these budget cuts has some ripple effects, and with those effects, it could be the beginning of an end for some of the departments, eventually shutting down departments, just like what they did to some of the sports departments.</h2>

        <div class="tenthtext">
        <h1><em>Anesha Green ~</em></h1>
        <h2>Visual Communication major at SFSU, and budget cuts have made it nearly impossible to stay on track. Classes are being canceled, lack of online and evening options, and waitlists are overloaded. What’s most frustrating is the lack of support and real transparency from the administrationemails go unanswered, decisions are unclear, and students are left to navigate the chaos alone. I’ve considered leaving—not because I’ve given up, but because the support we need isn’t there. We are the students, and the quality of our learning should be the top priority.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="eleventext">
        <h1><em>Andrew ~</em></h1>
        <h2>My name is Andrew, I am a Visual Communications Design major, and by the end of this semester I will be entering my last year here at San Francisco State. I had initially been preparing myself to just worry about the potential workload for my classes next year so I am able to graduate, but now with these unfair budget cuts my path to graduation has become murkier, and more expensive. Our education should not be marred with high costs and our paths to graduation becoming more difficult, and those two things for me, have been the consequences of these budget cuts; I really would like to know what was in the heads of the higher ups or whoever the people were behind this decision despite having plenty enough money for themselves.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="twelvetext">
        <h1><em>Destiney ~</em></h1>
        <h2>My name is Destiney, and I'm an Anthropology major. Going to college has been incredibly challenging for me, especially since I’ve been in school much longer than the typical four-year timeline. I've had to drop classes simply because I couldn't afford the rising tuition costs. At the same time, the quality of my education has declined—teachers and staff are being cut, classes are harder to access, and the overall support feels weaker. It often feels like the system is designed to keep us enrolled longer just to squeeze more money out of us. It's as if they don't want us to receive an education.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="thirteentext">
        <h1><em>Hongliang Dong ~</em></h1>
        <h2>What hurts most about these changes is the uncertainty. Not knowing if I will get the classes that I need or if I will even graduate on time. The stress and anxiety feel endless.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="fourteentext">
        <h1><em>Becky Jiang ~</em></h1>
        <h2>My name is Becky Jiang, and I am a VisComm major at SFSU. Because of recent budget cuts and rising tuition costs, I have experienced increasing financial stress. My path to graduation is now uncertain with fewer classes being offered and faculty being fired. These cuts go directly against what the SFSU community was promised.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="fifteentext">
        <h1><em>Jasmine Perez ~</em></h1>
        <h2>What hurts most about these changes is that it is effecting everyone, delaying graduation and increasing stress among my peers. Delayed graduation leads to a delay in students entering the workforce, adding stress to their finances on top of the stress of their current classes. Without necessary classes and support, my ability to graduate on time has been delayed as I cannot get into the classes I need.</h2>
